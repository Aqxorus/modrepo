# Compatibility

## Compatibility between mod versions

Generally it is always recommended, that you use the exact same version on server and client.


This mod follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
This means version `1.2.3` has a major version of `1`, a minor version of `2` and a patch version of `3`.
So, as a rule of thumb, only the major and minor versions need to match.
So for example you can join a server with version `1.2.3`, your client can also have version `1.2.0` or `1.2.5`.

## Compatibility between Minecraft versions

Since version `2.1.0` of Simple Voice Chat, the mod is compatible between Minecraft versions with the help of tools like [ViaVersion](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/viaversion.19254/) or [ViaBackwards](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/viabackwards.27448/).
But you still have to consider the compatibility between the mod versions, as described above.
