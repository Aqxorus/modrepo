## Config File Locations & Documentation

::: danger NOTE
If you are using older versions of the mod (older than 2.4.0), please check out [this](old_config).

- [Client Config File](client_config)
- [Server Config File](server_config)
- [Proxy Config File](proxy_config)

## Troubleshooting Config Issues

While editing configuration files, make sure the client/server is stopped. If the config values keep resetting, this is most likely the problem.

If you can't find the config files, make sure the client/server was started at least once, so that the files are generated.
