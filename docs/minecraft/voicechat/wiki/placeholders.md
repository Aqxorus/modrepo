# Placeholders

::: warning NOTE
This feature is subject to change in future versions.
:::

The plugin version of Simple Voice Chat has support for [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/) placeholders.

| Placeholder                         | Description                                             | Default |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `%voicechat_prefix_uses_voicechat%` | If the player uses Simple Voice Chat                    | `§a`    |
| `%voicechat_prefix_no_voicechat%`   | If the player does not have Simple Voice Chat installed | `§c`    |
| `%voicechat_prefix_disabled%`       | If the player disabled voice chat                       | `§c`    |

You can change the value of the placeholders in the translation config file (`plugins/voicechat/translations.properties`).
