# Vehicle Operation

## Starting The Car

To drive, you have to turn on your engine first by pressing and holding the `R` key until the car is started.


If your car won't start anymore it is maybe because your battery is empty.
You can recharge your car battery either by driving around or by putting a fully charged battery into the slot with the battery icon.
A fully charged battery contains 500 RF.
This is enough to fill your car battery halfway.


The starting time of your car is dependent on multiple factors.

- Engine temperature
  - If your engine is cold, the car takes longer to start.
  - The engine temperature rises if your engine is running.
  - If your engine is turned off, the engine temperature will slowly decrease.
  - If your car is parked in a cold biome, the engine can get colder than in warmer biomes.
- Car damage
  - If your car is damaged, it takes longer to start.
  - This gets worse the higher the amount of damage is.
- Battery status
  - If your battery gets emptier, your car takes longer to start.
 

## Fuel

When you spawn your car on the workshop, it will have 10% of fuel.
So you can drive to the next fuel station.
You can also refuel your car with a canister.


The canister can be refueled by shift-right-clicking a fuel station.
To refuel your car with a canister you have to put the canister in the slot with the canister icon.


If you have run out of fuel, you can push your car by sneaking against it.

## Repairing/Destroying

You can repair your car in the car workshop or with a repair kit.
The repair kit will repair 5% of damage, by putting it into the slot with the repair kit icon.


`1.10.X - 1.12.X` Be aware that if your car has 95% or more damage, the car will get destroyed if a player (that is not in creative mode) hits the car. If you want to destroy a car in creative mode, just sneak + hit the car.

`1.14+` You can destroy your car by holding a Hammer/Screw Driver/Wrench in your hand and hitting it twice within half a second.


Your car can get damage if you drive against other cars or blocks.
It can also get damage by being in contact with water or lava.
Your car can't get damage by hitting it or by any other means.

## Car Interaction

By pressing `I` while sitting in the car, the car UI will open.
Here you can check your car's damage, fuel level and Inventory.
There will also be your damage indication and your car inventory.
You can also access your the car GUI from the outside by shift + right-clicking it.

For transporters, the outside inventory is a separate inventory, so you can transport more stuff.

## Keys

If you craft a vehicle, you will get two keys which will be in the car inventory.
You can lock and unlock your car by right-clicking the key when you are in the range of 25 blocks.
You can duplicate your key by putting a key and an iron ingot into a crafting table. The new key will be a copy of your old key.
