# Car Crafting

To craft a car we need one car workshop block and 8 car workshop parts.
Note that this is a multiblock structure and will not work when it is not completed.
Place the car workshop surrounded by 8 workshop parts.
To use the workshop, right-click on it.

## Car Recipes

### Minecraft 1.10.X - 1.12.X

You can choose your car color by using different colors for the car parts.
For the wooden cars, you can use every wood type you like for the car body part item.
You can not mix colors.
For the other vehicles, you can use the 16 different hardened clay colors.
If this is a bit confusing, simply look at the car crafting recipes via [Just Enough Items](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei).


With the workshop, you also can repair your car.
You have to craft the tools required to repair the car and put them into place on the workshop repair GUI.
Remember that your car has to be on top of the workshop area to get noticed.

### Minecraft 1.14+

As the base of your car, you need a body.

There are 5 different types of bodies:

- The wooden body (Available in all wood types)
- The big wooden body (Available in all wood types)
- The transporter body (Available in every Minecraft dye color)
- The SUV body (Available in every Minecraft dye color)
- The sportscar body (Available in every Minecraft dye color)

Next, you need wheels for your car.
There are 2 types of wheels: Big wheels and normal wheels.


Every car except the transporter needs 4 wheels.
The transporter needs 6 wheels.
The SUV needs big wheels and every other car needs small wheels.
Note that you have to put each wheel in a separate slot of the car.


Your vehicle also needs an engine. There are three types of engines: A 3 cylinder engine, a 6 cylinder engine and a truck engine (1.14+ only). The 6 cylinder engine makes your car much faster but also needs more fuel. The truck engine is the most fuel efficient engine.


Another required component is the tank.
There are 3 different types of tanks: Small, medium and large.
The small tank can hold 500 mb of fuel, the medium 1000 mb and the large tank 1500 mb.


These components are the essentials to build a car.
The following parts are optional.


With the license plate holder, you are able to mount a license plate with custom text to your car.
A license plate can be written on by right-clicking it.
You can apply a license plate to a car by sneaking and right-clicking the plate on the car. Note that this requires a license plate holder on the car.


The bumper can be added to all wooden cars, but is only cosmetic.


Transporters are able to have either a container that extends your cars inventory or a tank container, that hold up to 64,000 mb of fluid.
