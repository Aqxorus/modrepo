    <h1>Fuel Production</h1>
    <p>
      First, we need to collect canola seeds.
      <br />They can be obtained the same way as normal seeds. Simply destroy grass.
      <br />You can cultivate and harvest canola the same way as wheat.
      <br />Now we need an oil mill to produce canola oil out of the crops.
      <br />To operate the mill we need energy from a dynamo with a crank.
      <br />Later you can use a generator, which is far more efficient but requires fuel and an engine to operate.
      <br />To operate the dynamo, place the crank on top of the dynamo block and right-click it to produce electricity.
    </p>
    <p>
      You need to connect the dynamo and the mill with a cable.
      <br />Now we can produce canola oil. The mill will collect the oil.
      <br />You will get canola cake as a byproduct, which can be used to breed all animals that can be bred with wheat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, we require methanol.
      <br />You need to craft a blast furnace and put wood logs into it.
      <br />The furnace also needs energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we need to mix both fluids in the backmix reactor. You can connect the oil mill and the blast furnace with fluid pipes to the backmix reactor.
      <br />Do not forget to put fluid extractors at the mill and the furnace to get the fluids flowing!
      <br />The backmix reactor also needs to be connected to the dynamo to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, we need a split tank.
      <br />Now simply connect the backmix reactor and the split tank with fluid pipes and a fluid extractor.
      <br />The split tank doesn't need electricity to work.
      <br />Only time!
    </p>
    <p>
      By the way, you can always store your fluids in tanks after every step.
      <br />Do not forget the fluid extractors and make sure you are not mixing up your fluids as it can mess up your process.
      <br />To prevent mixing of different fluids, you can use filters in fluid extractors.
    </p>
    <p>
      For filters, you have to gather one bucket of the specific fluid.
      <br />This may take a while.
      <br />To apply a filter, you can place a bucket (filled with the specific fluid you want to filter) in the slot of the fluid extractor (Right-click the fluid extractor to see the slot).
    </p>
    <p>
      The split tank will output two different fluids.
      <br />One is biodiesel, which we can collect in a tank or directly output to a fuel station.
      <br />The other is glycerin, which for now, is useless but has to be collected in a tank to make the split tank process go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      With enough fuel produced, you can craft a generator powered with biodiesel.
      <br />The generator is far more efficient than the dynamo.
      <br />You can supply the generator directly with biodiesel from a fluid pipe or with a canister.

    <h2>Sidenotes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Do not forget to put fluid extractors at blocks you want to pump from to get the fluids flowing.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>One tank stores 16 buckets of fluid.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>16 buckets = 16000mb (millibuckets).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>To get fuel out of a tank with a bucket, the tank must have at least ONE bucket (1000mb) of content.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you can not see any fluids (in tanks), be reminded that for example, 100mb = 1/10 Minecraft buckets! This is not much and can barely be seen.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Oil mills, blast furnaces and backmix reactors do have an energy storage.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>All machines do have an integrated fluid buffer storage.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>It is recommended to use fluid filters in fuel extractors to prevent fluid blocking.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You can connect as many tanks as you wish by placing them side by side.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you break a tank with fluid, the tank will store the fluid.</p>
