    <h1>Car Crafting</h1>
    <p>
      To craft a car we need one car workshop block and 8 car workshop parts.
      <br />Note that this is a multiblock structure and will not work when it is not completed.
      <br />Place the car workshop surrounded by 8 workshop parts.
      <br />To use the workshop, right-click on it.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Car Recipes</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Minecraft 1.10.X - 1.12.X</h3>
    <p>
      You can choose your car color by using different colors for the car parts.
      <br />For the wooden cars, you can use every wood type you like for the car body part item.
      <br />You can not mix colors.
      <br />For the other vehicles, you can use the 16 different hardened clay colors.
      <br />If this is a bit confusing, simply look at the car crafting recipes via&nbsp;

    </p>
    <p>
      With the workshop, you also can repair your car.
      <br />You have to craft the tools required to repair the car and put them into place on the workshop repair GUI.
      <br />Remember that your car has to be on top of the workshop area to get noticed.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Minecraft 1.14.X</h3>
    <p>As the base of your car, you need a body.</p>
    <p>There are 5 different types of bodies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The wooden body (Available in all wood types)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The big wooden body (Available in all wood types)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The transporter body (Available in every Minecraft dye color)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The SUV body (Available in every Minecraft dye color)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The sportscar body (Available in every Minecraft dye color)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Next, you need wheels for your car.
      <br />There are 2 types of wheels: Big wheels and normal wheels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every car except the transporter needs 4 wheels.
      <br />The transporter needs 6 wheels.
      <br />The SUV needs big wheels and every other car needs small wheels.
      <br />Note that you have to put each wheel in a seperate slot of the car.
    </p>
    <p>Your vehicle also needs an engine. There are three types of engines: A 3 cylinder engine, a 6 cylinder engine and a truck engine (1.14+ only). The 6 cylinder engine makes your car much faster but also needs more fuel. The truck engine is the most fuel efficient engine.</p>
    <p>
      Another required component is the tank.
      <br />There are 3 different types of tanks: Small, medium and large.
      <br />The small tank can hold 500 mb of fuel, the medium 1000 mb and the large tank 1500 mb.
    </p>
    <p>
      These components are the essentials to build a car.
      <br />The following parts are optional.
    </p>
    <p>With the license plate holder, you are able to mount a license plate with custom text to your car.</p>
    <p>A license plate can be written on by right-clicking it.</p>
    <p>You can apply a license plate to a car by sneaking and right-clicking the plate on the car. Note that this requires a license plate holder on the car.</p>
    <p>The bumper can be added to all wooden cars, but is only cosmetical.</p>
    <p>Transporters are able to have either a container that extends your cars inventory or a tank container, that hold up to 64,000 mb of fluid.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Vehicle Operation</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Starting The Car</h3>
    <p>To drive, you have to turn on your engine first by pressing and holding the 'R' key until the car is started.</p>
    <p>
      If your car won't start anymore it is maybe because your battery is empty.
      <br />You can recharge your car battery either by driving around or by putting a fully cahrged battery into the slot with the battery icon.
      <br />A fully charged battery contains 500 RF.
      <br />This is enough to fill your car battery halfway.
    </p>
    <p>The starting time of your car is dependent on multiple factors.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Engine temperature
        <ul>
          <li>If your engine is cold, the car takes longer to start.</li>
          <li>The engine temperaturte rises if your engine is running.</li>
          <li>If your engine is turned off, the engine temperature will slowly decrease.</li>
          <li>If your car is parked in a cold biome, the engine can get colder than in warmer biomes.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Car damage
        <ul>
          <li>If your car is damaged, it takes longer to start.</li>
          <li>This gets worse the higher the amount of damage is.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Battery status
        <ul>
          <li>If your battery gets emptier, your car takes longer to start.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Fuel</h3>
    <p>
      When you spawn your car on the workshop, it will have 10% of fuel.
      <br />So you can drive to the next fuel station.
      <br />You can also refuel your car with a canister.
    </p>
    <p>
      The canister can be refuelled by shift-right-clicking a fuel station.
      <br />To refuel your car with a canister you have to put the canister in the slot with the canister icon.
    </p>
    <p>If you have run out of fuel, you can push your car by sneaking against it.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Repairing/Destroying</h3>
    <p>
      You can repair your car in the car workshop or with a repair kit.
      <br />The repair kit will repair 5% of damage, by putting it into the slot with the repair kit icon.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      <code>1.10.X - 1.12.X</code> Be aware that if your car has 95% or more damage, the car will get destroyed if a player (that is not in creative mode) hits the car. If you want to destroy a car in creative mode, just sneak + hit the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>1.14+</code> You can destroy your car by holding a Hammer/Screw Driver/Wrench in your hand and hitting it twice within half a second.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      Your car can get damage if you drive against other cars or blocks.
      <br />It can also get damage by being in contact with water or lava.
      <br />Your car can't get damage by hitting it or by any other means.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Car Interaction</h3>
    <p>
      By pressing 'I' while sitting in the car, the car-UI will open.
      <br />Here you can check your car's damage, fuel level and Inventory.
      <br />There will also be your damage indication and your car inventory.
      <br />You can also access your the car GUI from the outside by shift + right-clicking it.
    </p>
    <p>For transporters, the outside inventory is a separate inventory, so you can transport more stuff.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Keys</h3>
    <p>
      If you craft a vehicle, you will get two keys which will be in the car inventory.
      <br />You can lock and unlock your car by right-clicking the key when you are in the range of 25 blocks.
      <br />You can duplicate your key by putting a key and an iron ingot into a crafting table. The new key will be a copy of your old key.
