    <h1>Icons</h1>

    <p>Maybe you have noticed that the icons of the voice chat have changed.</p>

    <p>
      If you want the old icons back, you can select the classic icons in the
      resource pack menu. Alternatively, there are also options for all icons to
      have white or black outlines.
