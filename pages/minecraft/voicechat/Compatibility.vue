    <h1>Compatibility between versions</h1>

    <p>
      Generally it is always recommended, that you use the exact same version on server and client.
    </p>

    <p>
      This mod follows <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a>.
      This means version <code>1.2.3</code> has a major version of <code>1</code>, a minor version of <code>2</code> and a patch version of <code>3</code>.
      So, as a rule of thumb, only the major and minor versions need to match.
      So for example you can join a server with version <code>1.2.3</code>, your client can also have version <code>1.2.0</code> or <code>1.2.5</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This doesn't mean the mod is compatible across Minecraft versions.
      Mods or plugins like ViaVersion are also not supported.
