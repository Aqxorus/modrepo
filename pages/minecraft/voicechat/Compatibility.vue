    <h1>Compatibility between mod versions</h1>

    <p>
      Generally it is always recommended, that you use the exact same version on
      server and client.
    </p>

    <p>
      This mod follows <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a>.
      This means version <code>1.2.3</code> has a major version of
      <code>1</code>, a minor version of <code>2</code> and a patch version of
      <code>3</code>. So, as a rule of thumb, only the major and minor versions
      need to match. So for example you can join a server with version
      <code>1.2.3</code>, your client can also have version
      <code>1.2.0</code> or <code>1.2.5</code>.

    <h1>Compatibility between Minecraft versions</h1>

    <p>
      Since version <code>2.1.0</code> of Simple Voice Chat, the mod is
      compatible between Minecraft versions with the help of tools like
      <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/viaversion.19254/"
        >ViaVersion</a
      >
      or
      <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/viabackwards.27448/"
        >ViaBackwards</a
      >. But you generally need to respect the compatibility between mod
      versions as described above.
