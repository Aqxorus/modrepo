    <p>
      If you are thinking you encountered a bug, please report it to the issue tracker,
      but please don't open a new issue, just to ask why it says "Voice Chat Unavailable".
    </p>

    <p>
      I am doing this in my spare time and I don't have time to help everyone that doesn't know how to set it up.
      Everything needed to set up the voice chat is described in the Setup section of the wiki.

      If you are using a Minecraft server hoster, ask them for support.
      If you are hosting the server by yourself, you should be familiar with forwarding ports.
