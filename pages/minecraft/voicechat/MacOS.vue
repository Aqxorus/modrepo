    <h1>MacOS Microphone Permission</h1>

    <p>
      MacOS requires any application that wants to use the microphone to show a
      permission dialog.
      <br />
      Since Minecraft iself doesn't need the microphone, we are not able to
      request access for it.
      <br />
      However some launchers add the ability to ask for microphone permission.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to use the voice chat on MacOS, you need to use
      <a href="https://prismlauncher.org/">Prism Launcher</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>For Advanced Users <i>(WIP)</i></h2>

    <p>
      If you are experienced with MacOS, you can do the following steps to get
      other launchers to request microphone permissions.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>NOTE</b>: We do not provide support for issues with your microphone
      permissions if you are not using a recommended launcher.
